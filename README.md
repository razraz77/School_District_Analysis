# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to deterime what effect the academic misconduct of the nineth graders at Thomas High School had on the scores in relation to other schools.

The results show that:
-the schools overall rating droped by 2 in the disterect summery
-although there was a minumal effect ot the schools total outcome, there was still a slight drop in the total school summery
-replacing the ninthgraders scores proved to drop te schools performance relative to other schools
    -since the reading marks were uneffected, the scores in that category remained the same while dropping in relation to the school's spending, size and type
